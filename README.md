# RF-Current-Source

A wideband radiofrequency voltage-controlled current source designed by D. Barker and A. Restelli.
Our design is released under the CERN Open Hardware License v1.2.

The eagle files in this repository will be much easier to use with [eagle-config](https://github.com/JQIamo/eagle-config) installed and configured.

For detailed documentation, go to the [Wiki](https://github.com/JQIamo/aom-driver/wiki/AOM-Driver-Wiki). A detailed write-up of the RF current source's specifications can be found in our paper.
