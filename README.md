# RF-Current-Source

A wideband radiofrequency voltage-controlled current source designed by D. Barker and A. Restelli.
Our design is released under the CERN Open Hardware License v1.2 and can be cited using [![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.3758488.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3758488).

The eagle files in this repository will be much easier to use with [eagle-config](https://github.com/JQIamo/eagle-config) installed and configured.

For more detailed documentation, go to the [Wiki](https://github.com/JQIamo/RF-Current-Source/wiki/). A detailed write-up of the RF current source's specifications can be found in our paper.
